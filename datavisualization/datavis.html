    <h1 align=center>Navient Complaints in Maryland vs Missouri</h1>
    <h2 align=center>by Kara Thompson</h2>

<p> Navient Corporation, the nation’s largest student loan servicers, have been <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/involved"> in a growing number of lawsuits</a> since 2017. Among those suing Navient are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a group of teachers, and several state attorneys. The CFPB has kept a <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2022-04-16&date_received_min=2019-04-16&lens=Overview&searchField=all&searchText=Navient&tab=Trends">record</a> of all the complaints lodged against Navient. There have been 2,602,701 in the time period between April 16, 2019 and April 16, 2022.</p>

<p>Maryland, which has a population of 6,177,224, registered 205 of those complaints during that time frame. Those complaints fell into three categories: student loan complaints, credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports complaints and debt collection complaints. About 2/3 of the complaints had to do with student loans; one quarter had to do with other personal reports, while just 7% had to do with debt collection.</p>

  <p>The state of Missouri has a similar population size to Maryland, with 6,154,913 residents. There were only 104 Navient complaints from the state in the period between April 2019 and April 2022. A little over 2/3 of the complaints in Missouri also had to do with student loans. About 28% were regarding other personal reports, which was 3% more than the Maryland complaints. But only a little under 5% had to do with debt collection, a little under Maryland’s rate.</p>

  <p>Although the states are not near each other geographically, they have very similar population sizes. While Maryland had about 100 more complaints in the three year time frame, each state had roughly the same percentage within the three different categories of complaints.</p>
